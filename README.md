# Codewars samples

Source code samples of solved [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/about) tasks.
Viewing source codes on codewars requires registered developer account, so I placed them there.
Each file has a hyperlink to page with description of a task, it should be available for anyone.

* [/php](https://github.com/dzhdmitry/cw/tree/master/php) - PHP 7 tasks
* [/sql](https://github.com/dzhdmitry/cw/tree/master/sql) - PostreSQL tasks

### QA

* **What for is it there?**

  To answer a question as "Show me some of your source code"

* **Why classes are placed in single file, why no each class in a file by itself, as per PSR?**

  Just to easy copy-paste from/to codewars editor.

* **Why are there ambiguous classes/functions in the task?**

  Each task comes with class/function with pre-defined name that will be used for testing
